  overview: 'Autism is a bio neurological difference in how the brain is wired. They experience the world differently and can benefit from learning from each other. No matter how well they learn to compensate for these differences, people on the spectrum will always think and feel a little differently from us. That is not good or bad, but unique to the experience of autism. We can learn a lot from people with autism, as they can from us.\n\nAutism therapeutic intervention will carry all holistic domains to respect, connect, develop, explore skills to individuals to learn, accept, embrace our differences in thinking, social, communication, psychological, sensorial areas to stimulate them and make them functionally potential and independent.',
