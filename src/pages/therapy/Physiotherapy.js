  overview: 'Physiotherapy is the health profession with expertise in movement and exercise prescription throughout the lifespan across the health spectrum.\n\nOur Physiotherapists are autonomous health professionals who are responsible for developing, maintaining or restoring motor function and movement throughout the lifespan using evidence-based practice. They relieve pain and treat or prevent physical conditions associated with injury, disease or other impairments. Our Physiotherapists empower all of our children and their carers to manage the condition outside clinical settings. Our team work within their scope of practice and their professional Code of Conduct.\n\nPhysiotherapy involves specific interventions to individuals and populations where movement and function are, or may be, threatened by illness, ageing, injury, pain, disability, disease, disorder or environmental factors. Such interventions are designed and prescribed to develop, restore and maintain optimal health.\n\nPhysiotherapy is integral to all spheres of health and well-being such as promotion, prevention, habilitation and rehabilitation and encompasses physical, psychological, emotional and social factors.\n\nPhysiotherapy involves the interaction of the physiotherapist with the client including his/her family, caregivers and relevant other health professionals and communities at large.',
