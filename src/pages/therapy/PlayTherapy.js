  overview: 'When our kids cannot express themselves through words, play can give therapists an entire insight into what is happening in their lives.\n\nWhen our kids engage in play, they stimulate their imaginations and learn to be creative through the activities they are involved in. The way we let them Play also teaches our kids how to share, deal with conflict resolution, take turns, and respond to emotions appropriately, according to Lifespan. As such, it is easy to see why play is used when helping kids talk about their emotions, which is not always so easy for little ones especially to do. And it is because of this that our play therapy modules came to be and why it has been so beneficial to our kids.',
